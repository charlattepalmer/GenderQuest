##You are: Melody's Mom
##Location: Your house

*Your daughter Melody receives a barbie doll from one of her friends for her sixth birthday. It is
a doll with a button on its stomach, and when you press the button it plays a recorded message.
Your daughter's Barbie says "Math is hard."*

**Do you:**

a) [Laugh and continue to watch her press the button](/node/barbie_1)

b) [Horrified, snatch it out of her hands and throw it away](/node/barbie_2)

c) [Explain to her that she can be great at math, and not to listen to the toy](/node/barbie_3)
