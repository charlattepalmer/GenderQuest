## Location: San Francisco

*You are in your mid-twenties. You have just started a new job at a biotech company. One day, as
you are programming, you happen to notice that your boss is in the middle of a conversation with
another intern, this one male. You can't help but overhear part of their exchange. They are
discussing an upcoming project that your boss wants the intern to join, even though you have
more experience and background and haven't been invited. Slightly shocked, you wonder what to
do.*

b) [Ask your boss what they are talking about](/node/equal_pay_2)

c) [Inform your boss that you want to participate in the project](/node/equal_pay_3)
