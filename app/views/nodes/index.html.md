*I created this site to teach both girls and boys alike the influence media has on every one of us.
In our modern world, we can hardly go a couple feet without running into another sexualized
advertisement or gender-discriminatory billboard. And that's why I believe it is so very important
to educate the next generation about this epidemic of false images and information that we are
bombarded with every day of our lives.*

**If you're a girl, you will understand this journey.**

Almost every one of you has been influenced by the media at some point in your lives.

Whether it's at school, on the soccer field, even at home, you have most likely experienced gender
discrimination in some form.

**If you're a boy, this is something new.**

You get to witness firsthand a world where you are the lower class.

You get to experience inequality in everyday life.

**Regardless of your gender, I hope you learn something from this.**

I hope that you finally understand that every little action, every minuscule comment has a huge
impact.

**Without further ado, here is Gender Quest: Delving Deeper into the Effect of
Media Influence and What You Can Do to Prevent It**
