## You are: Melissa
## Location: School

*In class one day, you are talking about models with your friends, including Melody. "My favorite
model is Heidi Klum!" you gush to the girls surrounding you. "Hey, Melody kind of looks like
Heidi!" one girl calls out, and everyone instantly agrees. You are jealous and want to be the
center of attention, but now Melody has taken that from you.

**Do you:**

a) [Say "Melody's way too fat to be Heidi!"](/node/fat_1)

b) [Say "Heidi's a lot thinner though."](/node/fat_2)

c) [Ignore your jealousy and let Melody be the center of attention](/node/fat_3)
