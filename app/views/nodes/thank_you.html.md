##You have completed Gender Quest.

*Thank you for participating in this journey, and I hope you learned something new today. Media
influence has taken the lives of many girls and prevented many women from reaching their full
career potential, though this problem can be solved by educating the next generation about the
negative influences that affect so many girlsâ€™ lives. And that's where you come in. Please be
aware of your actions, because everything you say, big or small, has an impact. Please pass this
on to your friends, as together we can work to make sure that every girl has an opportunity in
life equal to her male counterparts.*
