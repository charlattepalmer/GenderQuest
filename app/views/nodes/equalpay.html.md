*You are in your mid-twenties. You have just started a new internship at a tech company. One day, as
you are programming, you happen to notice that your boss is in the middle of a conversation with
another intern, this one male. You can't help but overhear part of their exchange. They are
discussing wage. Your boss is telling him how much he will be payed, and you notice that the amount
he is offered is nearly three times the amount you are being payed, even though you have the same
amount of experience and background, maybe even a tad more. Slightly shocked, you wonder what to do.*

**Do you:**

a) [Continue programming and pretend you never heard the conversation](/node/continue)

b) [Ask your boss what they are talking about](/node/boss)

c) [Inform your boss that you want to be payed the same amount as your male counterpart](/node/[pay])
