*It is your first day of college. As you are walking into your calculus class, a teacher stops you and
says "I think you're going the wrong way, that's the **calculus** classroom." He laughs.

**Do you:**

a) [Embarrassed that you're taking calculus, pretend you're lost](/node/college_1)

b) [Ask what he means](/node/college_2)
<div class="restrict" data-restrict-if-score-below=0 ></div>

c) [Inform him you are taking calculus](/node/college_3)
<div class="restrict" data-restrict-if-score-below=1 ></div>
