*In your fifth grade PE class you are choosing teams for dodgeball. You and the other team captain, another boy, have
chosen all boys so far for your teams. You notice that the girls tend to stand in back, as if they know that they
won't be chosen first.*

**Do you**

a) [Ignore them and continue to choose all boys](/node/teams_1)

b) [Ask why they're standing in the back](/node/teams_2)

c) [Choose girls as well as boys from now on](/node/teams_3)
