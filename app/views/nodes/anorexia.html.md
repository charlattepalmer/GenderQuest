*It has been two weeks since you daughter died of anorexia, and you still don't understand what
happened. She seemed perfectly happy; why, just the night before she had a sleepover with her
friends! You wonder if it's something you did or didn't do. One thing is certain: you won't be
getting any sleep tonight.*
